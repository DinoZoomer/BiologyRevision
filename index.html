      homeostasis

    <div class="pos2">
      <p>
        this is an organisms ability to regulate / control it's internal conditions so that crucial reactions can occur at an optimal rate<br><br>This includes: </p><p class="pos3">blood glucose concentration, internal temperature, water levels</p>

      The Nervous System
    </p>
    <div class="pos2">
      <p>
        The central nervous system (CNS) is made of the brain and the spinar Chord<br><br>The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is made of all the other nerves.<br><br>Most actions take the route of: </p><p class="pos3">stimulus -> receptor -> sensory neurone -> relay neurone -> CNS (brain or spine) -> motor neurone -> effector</p>

      The eye
    </p>
    <div class="pos2">
      <p>
        the eye is fundementally made up of a lens, ciliary muscles, and suspensory ligaments. <br><br> When looking at something close:
        <div class="pos3">
          <p>
            the lens needs to become thicker (light refract more), to do this the ciliary muscles will contract while suspensory ligaments relax.</p>
        </div>
      <p>When looking at something far:</p>
      <div class="pos3">
        <p>
          the lens needs to become thinner (light refract less), to do this the ciliary muscles relax and the suspensory ligaments tighten.</p>
        myopia (short sighted) the light converges before retina - need to refract less <br><br> hyperopia (long sighted) light converges after retina - need to refract more

      DNA
    </p>
    <div class="pos2">
      <p>
        Dna is a double stranded double helix<br><br>The Polymer is made of a phosphate, sugar and base. A - T, C - G<br><br>Eukaryotic: chromosomes, nucleus<br><br>Genes code for a sequence of DNA (specific amino acid)<br><br>Genome is all of the DNA for an organism<br><br>There are non coding sections which dont code for a protein but can control gene expression (whether it is used or not)

      Protein synthesis
    </p>
    <div class="pos3">
      <p>
        Proteins are made at ribosomes<br><br>
        1. transcription:<br>
        - in the nucleus, the dna is split open<br>- a completely different mRNA strand is made using enzymes<br>- mRNA leaves the nucleus to go to ribosome<br><br>
        2. Translation:<br>
        - ribosome binds to mRNA<br>
        - 'reads' 3 nucleotides at a time<br>
        - tRNA brings the correct amino acid for the triplet nucleotides to the ribosome<br>
        - ribosome binds the amino acids together to create polypeptide<br>
        - folds into correct shape<br><br>

          fertilisation<br>
          restores diploid number<br>
          give genetic variation<br>
          less offspring<br>
          slower<br>
          more energy required<br>

      Kidneys:
    </p>
    <div class="pos2">
      <p>
      Kidneys make urine <br><br>
      Filtration
      </p>
      <div class="pos3">
        <p>
          blood taken to kidneys via renal artery<br><br>
          blood stays in capillary<br><br>
          substances dissolved in plasma are filtered into the urine<br><br>
          selective reabsorbtion is where useful products taken back to the blood such as glucose and amino acids<br><br>
          when ions are needed, ions will be selectively reabsorbed aswell by the kidneys to ensure water levels
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      anti diuretic hormone (ADH):
    </p>
    <div class="pos3">
      <p>
        made in the pituitary gland<br><br>
        makes the kidney tubiles less permeable to water<br><br>
        therefore less water is reabsorbed from filtrate<br><br>
        therefore urine becomes more dilute<br><br>
        less ADH causes the opposite to occur
      </p>

      Dialysis:
    </p>
      <div class="pos3">
        <p>
          glucose has no diffusion gradient - stays in blood<br><br>
          urea move from the blood down conc gradient into dialysis fluid<br><br>
          excess water from blood moves into dialysis<br><br>
          opposite directions maintains urea conc gradient<br><br>
